## Todo
- Scripts for sessions #2 - #8.

## Course setup
8 participants meet once every week for a 60 minute session with a teacher for a total of 8 sessions. Between sessions the participants will do homework on their own - mostly meditation practices.

The course will have a scientific viewpoint as a starting point, and everything taught should be verified in clinical trials and/or the participants own experiences. KPIs such as stress and focus will be measured before and after the course to determine the result and ROI.

### Target outcomes
This course aims to lower stress in all participants by an average of 25% as well as increase focus in all participants. I've been able to reproduce that result consistenly over my last 5 courses.

## The teachers job

In order to teach this course, you need to ...
- ... have the time to read through the documentation for all the sessions, send out all emails, coordinate room booking and invites, coach the participants in their training and manage the feedback and evaluations. **32 hours / course.**
- ... as well as the time and energy to stay up to date on the latest research on stress, performance, well-being and tools to optimize these areas. **4-12 hours / week.**
- ... and of course: a genuine interest in helping the participants increase their focus and lower their stress levels.

### Before and after the course
Let people in the office know you want to help them be more calm and focused.

- Sign up 8 participants.
- Book a room for all 8 sessions.
- Send meeting invites.
- Send [pre-course evaluation form](forms.md) along with course information. 

After the course,
- Send out [anonymous feedback form](forms.md).
- Compile feedback and set it to the group as a PDF, including the measurements of KPIs before and after.

### Every session
- Facilitate the exercises.
- Teach new methods and tools.
- Be an active listener and ask questions.
- Stay a while afterwards to answer questions from participants that they either didn't have the time to discuss during the session, or they want to do 1-on-1.
- Write down the key points from the session and email them to the group.

## Suggested reading
As a teacher, you want to have an understanding of stress, methods to counter stress including meditation, flow, organizational development, leadership and coaching. There are a myriad of books available on these topics, such as:
- Search Inside Yourself by Chade-Meng Tan
- Full Catastrophe Living by Jon Kabat-Zinn
- Focus by Daniel Goleman
- Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi
- Mindfulness by Joseph Goldstein
- The Buddha's Brain by Rick Hanson
- Waking Up by Sam Harris
- How The Mind Work by Steven Pinker
- Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux

## Tools
I use [Thriver](http://www.thriver.io) to measure stress levels of the participants during the course. It's helpful to do some A/B testing with another team that is not doing the course but with a similar situation. Thriver also includes guided meditations that the participants can use as homework.

You can also set up a Slack channel for the course where the group can bounce ideas, give feedback, motivate each others and ask for help.
