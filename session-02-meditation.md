In this session, participants will learn what meditation is, how to meditate, what happens in the body and brain when you meditate and some philosophical elements of the practice.

2. [Teaching](#2-teaching-meditation): meditation. (20 min)
3. [Method](#3-method-meditation): meditation. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](#4-reflection): reflection on meditation (10 min)

## 4. Reflection
Now, let every participant reflect on what was taught. It should not be a discussion at this point, but rather their own, unfiltered thoughts. Ask them when they think they will find the time to do the deep breathing. Point out to them that this is not a theoretical activity - it is a practical one. If they don't actually do the deep breathing, they will not get any results.

After the round, tell the group that you will be staying afterwards to answer any questions that you didn't have time to discuss during the session or that they would like to ask 1-on-1.
