# Session #1 - An overview of stress

In this session, participants will learn the basic theoretical framework of what causes stress, how stress activates in the physical body, why stress works in such a way, how stress relates to productivity and a simple method to battle stress - deep breathing.

## Setup
1. [Intro](#1-introduction): name and goal with signing up for the course. (10 min)
2. [Teaching](#2-teaching-an-overview-of-stress): an overview of stress. (20 min)
3. [Method](#3-method-deep-breathing): deep breathing. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](#4-reflection): reflection on deep breathing and homework. (10 min)

The teacher should note all key findings and questions in the session, and make sure to follow up on them in the email afterwards.

## 1. Introduction
Present yourself as a teacher. Name and background should be enough.
Ask the participants to present themselves with their names, how they spend their days, and what they hope to achieve by participating in the course. Take turns clock-wise around the table. 
Try to use mnemonics to learn their names right away, or write them down.

Make a group decision if you want to stay offline during the session. Previous participants have found it immensely calming to put away everything digital for one hour every week. If the group is hesitant, ask if they want to do it as an experiment. Try it out for a session, and make the decision at the end. 

## 2. Teaching: an overview of stress
Is stress good or bad? It depends. A bit of stress is good, it keeps us alert. But too much stress makes it hard to focus. The more stressed we are, the more we're prone to multi-tasking, which decreases productivity. Stress is also related to a bunch of diseases such as cardiovascular, psoriasis, and long-term stress could cause a burnout.

We're pretty good at increasing stress. Just take on a new project and drink a Red Bull.

For many of us, it's harder to calm down during the work day. In the worst cases, we use self-medication (smoking, drinking, porn, sugar) to make us feel good instead. 

You could talk about the causes of stress here, but I usually don't. People generally know how it works: too much or too little work, no sense of control, lack of feedback loops, no sense of purpose.

Participants usually find it more interesting to learn about the evolutionary causes of stress, and how that relates to how we physically react to stressful situations. The historical human beings became extremely good at identifiying and reacting to danger. Avoiding danger led to survival, which led to the strenghtening of that part of the brain - the amygdala - genetically.

This was awesome, because the dangers were usually life and death situations. Even social stress, with the risk of being excluded from the tribe, was lethal. A lone caveman/cavewoman did not survive for long.

But here in 2015, no real dangers are threatening us. Well, real threats like climate change are to abstract and far away to trigger the amygdala's fear response. We do, however, react to every sense of danger still. So when our project is going down the drain, our stress response sets in.

The stress response, called the fight-flight-or-freeze (or activating the sympathethic autonomous nervous system, if you want to be fancy) is tailored towards physical danger. It helps us run faster, basically. Our heartbeat increases, we start sweating, our pupils are dilated, and so forth. All of our senses are heightened so that we can hear and see danger everywhere.

This sucks in a modern workplace.

Because of the massive amount of stimuli we get today from the open office landscape as well as the notifications and distractions in the digital landscape, there are potential threats everywhere. If it was hard to focus from the start, it gets even harder when were stressed out. This could cause the feeling of not getting anywhere, which increases stress further. And high stress levels leads to less sleep which leads to more stress ...

We need a way to break this stress reaction, and make our bodies and minds more adapted to this new environment.

We could say that our brains are still buggy: optimized for an old operating system. 

## 3. Method: deep breathing
The easiest way to counter-act the fight-flight-or-freeze reaction is to breathe deeply.

Guide the partcipants to put a hand or their stomachs and expand the stomach on the in-breath, and collapse it on the out-breath. Good posture (i.e. sitting with a straight back) will help activating the diaphragm and thus deepening the breath.

Helpful tools include:
- Smiling
- Breathing through the nose
- Counting one on the in-breath, two on the out-breath, three on the in-breath and so forth, until ten. And then restarting.
- Making every breath last four seconds.
- Listening to calming music.

Ask the participants to try for themselves at home what works best for them.

Their *homework* is to do deep breathing twice every day for at least ten minutes. They could also, of course, deep breath whenever: in the line at a coffee shop, in the elevator, and so forth.

Do 10 minutes of deep breathing together. Answer any questions that might come up afterwards about the technique.

## 4. Reflection
Now, let every participant reflect on what was taught. It should not be a discussion at this point, but rather their own, unfiltered thoughts. Ask them when they think they will find the time to do the deep breathing. Point out to them that this is not a theoretical activity - it is a practical one. If they don't actually do the deep breathing, they will not get any results.

After the round, tell the group that you will be staying afterwards to answer any questions that you didn't have time to discuss during the session or that they would like to ask 1-on-1.

## Extra material
If there is additional time available, you could talk about these things as well:
- Show the Yerkes-Dodson graph which depicts the relationship between stress and productivity. Note that the bell curve looks different depending on the complexity and character of the activity.
- The interpretation of the body's stress response is key to making it positive or negative. The physical reaction to stress is mirrored by courage. We're getting ready for a fight. If you try to smile while feeling stressed, and make an active choice to see it as something helpful, it might stop a negative spiral of anxiety.
- Deep breathing is also a sort of yoga practice called pranayama. So, in a way, you've been doing yoga together during this session. Traditional yoga has eight parts, where one is breathing, one is postures (asanas), one is ethics, one is meditation, and so forth.
