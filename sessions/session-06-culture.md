# Session #6 - Culture

In this session, we will shift our focus from our individual training to how we as a group and organisation can maximize our levels of calm and focus.

## Setup
1. [Sharing](1-sharing): thoughts on flow. (10 min)
2. [Teaching](2-teaching-company-culture): company culture. (20 min)
3. [Method](3-methods-to-increase-group-productivity): ideas on improving group productivity. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](4-reflection). (10 min)

The teacher should note all key findings and questions in the session, and make sure to follow up on them in the email afterwards.

## 1. Sharing
Take turns clock-wise around the table and reflect on the previous week. What was your experience of having an hour of flow? Was it possible? Did you get more done? What distracted you? Did you notice any difference in stress levels?

As usual, make sure to let every person talk until they're finished. There's no need to rush them. Answer any questions, but try not to steer their reflection.

Ask the group to give each other advice. If someone wasn’t able to create time for flow, ask the group to brainstorm ideas on how the problem could be solved.

## 2. Teaching: company culture
There are many paradoxes surrounding meditation. One of them is that it’s a great self-help method but if you use it just to improve yourself, you’ll get stuck.

We need to look beyond ourselves.

So that’s what we’re looking at in this session. How can our team, our division or our entire company be improved by more awareness? 

For one thing, stress is contagious. By implementing stress management in the organisation at large, stress will not spread as fast when a deadline is coming up.

Many people who take this course talk about their managers being the source of stress. Are the managers aware of this? If not, how can we make them? And how can they utilize stress management methods to not only reduce their own stress levels, but also those of their coworkers?

Remember that meditation and mindfulness are not the best methods. Make sure people are getting enough sleep and have the time and energy to do physical exercise before you shove new tools down their throats. Most people don’t need more stuff to do: they need to prioritize what’s most important.

That could mean that they need to take a walk every day at work. Without their phones, preferably. Just walking.

## 3. Methods to increase group productivity
First off, you need to start measuring stress and well-being in the company. If you’re not doing that, you’ll have no idea what’s working and what’s not. I use [Thriver] in my courses but I’m biased towards it since I’m a part of the team. Do whatever works for you - but start measuring.

Now, there are a million ways to go about this. A simple method to start could be to do 10 minutes of stress management every day at 2:30 PM. Pick your own method. Is it meditation? Walking? Listening to classical music? Drinking tea and looking out the window?

It could be starting out every meeting with a minute or so of silence. Just to calm the mind. Or take a breather in the middle of the meeting - but don’t check the phones. Just sit down and breathe. When you find that you don’t have the time for taking two minutes, you should do five minutes.

The most important part is spreading a sense of commitment and responsibility throughout the organisation. A burnout is not one single persons fault. We’re all responsible for helping each other to battle stress. If you see someone looking very tired, or having a hard time remembering things, or rapidly gaining weight, these are all signals that something isn’t right. Ask them how they’re doing and what’s their stress level.

The groups **homework** is to be a secret stress Santa. They should pick someone at work which they will help optimize well-being and performance for. It could be by teaching them meditation, or bringing them out for a walk, or talking to them about their work. 

And of course - the best way to help others manage stress is to be calm yourself. The group should keep meditating for two times ten minutes every day.

## 4. Reflection
Take turns counter-clockwise to reflect on what was taught. Do they have other ideas on how to manage stress effectively in the group? Perhaps you could measure the six causes of stress (see session #1) and notice as soon as they start bugging you. 

Many participants appreciate the art of communication more after this course. For example, by writing a long, thorough, formatted email the recipient will feel less stressed than by getting something sloppy and incomplete. Include everything in the email - all contact information to other people involved, documents referenced, links where they can find more information, clear actions and deadlines.

After the round, tell the group that you will be staying afterwards to answer any questions that you didn't have time to discuss during the session or that they would like to ask 1-on-1. 

Finish by thanking them for their time and attention.

## Extra material
- It’s best to start small and measure. Make experiments for a couple of weeks, measure what happened and compare to the invested time. This way, there’s less friction in implementing change.
- If the group is up for it, you could try metta meditation. Ask the participants to meditate as usual to start with. Then ask them to wish themselves joy and picture themselves feeling happy. Ask them to do the same with every person in the room. Everyone in the company. And finally, to with someone they find challenging joy.
- Discuss why lowering stress could lead to increased productivity. For example, is it hard or easy to be creative in a stressful situation? Or to see things clearly? Sometimes there is a more elegant solution which has a high output and low input, but it’s hidden from us in our myopic stress mindset.
