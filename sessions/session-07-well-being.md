# Session #7 - Well-being

In this session, participants will learn about mindfulness, why it's kind of a useless word, and how to get better at it.

## Setup
1. [Sharing](#1-sharing): reflections on company culture. (10 min)
2. [Teaching](#2-teaching-well-being): well-being. (20 min)
3. [Method](#3-methods-to-increase-well-being): why and how to increase well-being. (20 min)
4. [Reflection](#4-reflection). (10 min)

The teacher should note all key findings and questions in the session, and make sure to follow up on them in the email afterwards.

## 1. Sharing
Take turns clock-wise around the table and reflect on the previous week. Did you make any adjustments to your team culture that improved (or worsened!) calm and focused work? Any tips and tricks to share with the rest of the group? Challenges?

If anyone achieved being a secret stress Santa, and helped someone else remove stress, asked them how they felt. That experienced is closely related to this weeks session. Which is …

## 2. Teaching: well-being
We talk a lot about happiness and well-being. But what does science really say in the matter? And how does it relate to productivity at work?

Here’s my hypothesis: many people switch jobs because they’re not happy. But the job isn’t really the problem.

Here’s the definition of well-being from Wikipedia:
"Wellness refers to diverse and interconnected dimensions of physical, mental, and social well-being that extend beyond the traditional definition of health. It includes choices and activities aimed at achieving physical vitality, mental alacrity, social satisfaction, a sense of accomplishment, and personal fulfillment."[1]

As this is a complex set of variables, it’s not easily solved by either meditation or one other method. 

Fact is that most of your well-being is out of your reach. From a scientific point of view, your happiness is decided between 30% and 50% based on your genetics. Tough luck.

What we can do is to train ourselves to look at a situation differently. 

## 3. Methods to increase well-being
We need to get rid of our negativity bias. 

That bias makes us see problems everywhere, rather than being happy about the things that are OK.

You do have a job, right?
And an OK body?
Friends, family, coworkers you like?
Food on the table.
And so forth.

There are two simple methods of working with negativity bias:

First first is practicing gratitude. Now, most people think gratitude should come after things work out our way. My experience is the opposite. When we actively seek out things to be grateful for, our awareness shifts and we see our situation in a more positive light.

It’s easy to start practicing gratitute. Write a list of things your grateful for. It’s important not just to list the items themselves but also *why* your thankful. Why are you thankful for your body?

If this feels phony, just give it a week. Try it out as an experiment. It might take a while to get used to.

Another method to battle negativity bias is to savor the moment. When something good happens - no matter how small - make an effort to appreciate it. It could be coffee. The sun. A nice painting. A text from someone you love. 

We’re so used to identify and work with problems we might miss the big picture. Many of us actually have really good lives but we only focus on the bad stuff. It’s been good from an evolutionary standpoint but it might not be as necessary anymore.

The **homework** for this week is to keep meditating for two times a day. The participants can exchange one of the sessions to gratitude list writing if they wish to do so.

## 4. Reflection
Take turns counter-clockwise to reflect on what was taught. Do you have a negativity bias? Or do you spend most of your day content? How about your team? What methods are you currently using to increase well-being? 

Also discuss how well-being relates to work. What would happen if the people in our organisation felt happy? Would they stay longer? Would we attract more talent? 

Let each participant talk until they're finished. Answer any questions that might come up, and note those you don't have an answer for.

After the round, tell the group that you will be staying afterwards to answer any questions that you didn't have time to discuss during the session or that they would like to ask 1-on-1. Thank them for their time and attention.

## Extra material
- The worlds happiest man according to science, Matthieu Ricard, says that metta meditation has improved his well-being immensely. You could send out his TED Talk (“The habits of happiness”) to the team as inspiration.
- Good physical health and good relationships seems to be the most important matters in improving well-being. That’s really not something this course can help with. Well, *maybe* EQ will help your relationships somewhat …
- A sense of community and having your daily actions correlated to your values is also super important. A sense of “we” and a sense of purpose. The company that solves this problem won’t have to worry about productivity hacks.
